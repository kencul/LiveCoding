# Live Coding Week 4 Ken Kobayashi

## Midterm Presentation Topic

I would like to do my presentations on the common software/languages used for live coding.

I would like to do this, as I have found different platforms do things better than others, and I would like to explore the different options available to me. This will help me choose languages to learn and have a flexible toolbox.

The list of software I would like to explore/present are:
- CSound
- SuperCollider
- Sonic Pi
- TidalCycles
- Pure Data
- Max
- FoxDot

I will choose my favorite among these, learn the basics, and do a small demo of each. I will then be able to give my personal opinions on which platforms felt the best to use, and provide pros and cons of each.
